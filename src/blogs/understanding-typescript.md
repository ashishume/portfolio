# Understanding TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds static type definitions to JavaScript.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers several advantages:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete and refactoring
- **Improved Code Quality**: Self-documenting code
- **Scalability**: Easier to maintain large codebases

## Basic Types

TypeScript provides several basic types:

\`\`\`typescript
let name: string = "John";
let age: number = 30;
let isActive: boolean = true;
\`\`\`

## Interfaces

Interfaces define the structure of objects:

\`\`\`typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

TypeScript is a powerful tool that can help you write more maintainable and scalable code.
